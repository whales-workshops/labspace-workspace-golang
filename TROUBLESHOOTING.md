# Problem Analysis and Solutions

## Issues Identified

### 1. gopls Not Accessible
**Cause**: `gopls` was installed by user 1000 in `/go/bin`, but after installation, the `/go` directory did not have the correct permissions to allow other users or processes to access the installed binaries.

**Applied Solution**:
- Added `chmod -R 775 /go` after gopls installation to ensure permissions allow read and execute access
- Permissions 775 allow the owner and group to have full rights, and other users to read and execute

### 2. Permission Errors When Running Go Programs
**Cause**:
- The `/go/pkg/mod/cache` directory was not created during the image build
- Permissions on `/go/pkg/mod` did not allow the user to create the `cache` subdirectory
- Go needs to create and write to `/go/pkg/mod/cache` to manage module cache

**Applied Solution**:
- Proactive creation of `/go/pkg/mod/cache` during image build with proper permissions
- Application of `chmod -R 775 /go` to ensure all subdirectories have correct permissions
- Double verification of permissions after gopls installation

## How to Test the New Image

### 1. Build the New Image

```bash
docker build -t labspace-golang-fixed .
```

### 2. Run a Container with a Non-Root User

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  -u 1000:1000 \
  labspace-golang-fixed \
  bash
```

### 3. Tests to Run Inside the Container

#### Test 1: Verify that gopls is Accessible
```bash
which gopls
# Should return: /go/bin/gopls

gopls version
# Should display the gopls version
```

#### Test 2: Create a Test Go Program
```bash
cat > test_main.go << 'EOF'
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/openai/openai-go/v2"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go!")
}
EOF
```

#### Test 3: Initialize a Go Module
```bash
go mod init test
```

#### Test 4: Run the Program
```bash
go run test_main.go
# Should display: Hello from Go!
# AND download dependencies without permission errors
```

#### Test 5: Verify Cache Permissions
```bash
ls -la /go/pkg/mod/cache/
# Should show that the directory exists and is writable
```

#### Test 6: Clean and Test Again
```bash
go clean -modcache
go run test_main.go
# Should work without errors
```

### 4. Test with a Different User (Optional)

To test with another UID:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  -u 1001:1001 \
  labspace-golang-fixed \
  bash
```

Then run the same tests as above. If the permissions are correctly configured (775), the user should be able to read and execute gopls, but may have write limitations in `/go/pkg/mod` (which is normal if you want to restrict access).

### 5. Verification in VS Code / code-server

If you're using code-server:

1. Open a `.go` file
2. Verify that autocompletion works
3. Check in the Go extension logs that gopls starts correctly
4. Run a Go program from the integrated terminal

## Summary of Changes

- ✅ Creation of `/go/pkg/mod/cache` during build
- ✅ Application of 775 permissions on the entire `/go` directory
- ✅ Double verification of permissions after gopls installation
- ✅ gopls accessible for all users in the group
- ✅ Go cache functional with proper permissions
